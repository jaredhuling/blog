Hugo keeps all static content under `static`. You should therefore move it all there.\nWith Jekyll, something that looked like\n\n    ▾ <root>/\n        ▾ images/\n            logo.png\n\nshould become\n\n    ▾ <root>/\n        ▾ static/\n            ▾ images/\n                logo.png\n\nAdditionally, you'll want any files that should reside at the root (such as `CNAME`) to be moved to `static`.\n\n## Create your Hugo configuration file\nHugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the [Hugo configuration documentation](/overview/configuration/) for details.\n\n## Set your configuration publish folder to `_site`\nThe default is for Jekyll to publish to `_site` and for Hugo to publish to `public`. If, like me, you have [`_site` mapped to a git submodule on the `gh-pages` branch](http://blog.blindgaenger.net/generate_github_pages_in_a_submodule.html), you'll want to do one of two alternatives:\n\n1. Change your submodule to point to map `gh-pages` to public instead of `_site` (recommended).\n\n        git submodule deinit _site\n        git rm _site\n        git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public\n\n2. Or, change the Hugo configuration to use `_site` instead of `public`.\n\n        {\n            ..\n            \"publishdir\": \"_site\",\n            ..\n        }\n\n## Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates\nThat's the bulk of the work right here. The documentation is your friend. You should refer to [Jekyll's template documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) if you need to refresh your memory on how you built your blog and [Hugo's template](/layout/templates/) to learn Hugo's way.\n\nAs a single reference data point, converting my templates for [heyitsalex.net](http://heyitsalex.net/) took me no more than a few hours.\n\n## Convert Jekyll plugins to Hugo shortcodes\nJekyll has [plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/); Hugo has [shortcodes](/doc/shortcodes/). It's fairly trivial to do a port.\n\n### Implementation\nAs an example, I was using a custom [`image_tag`](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/alexandre-normand/blob/74bb12036a71334fdb7dba84e073382fc06908ec/_plugins/image_tag.rb) plugin to generate figures with caption when running Jekyll. As I read about shortcodes, I found Hugo had a nice built-in shortcode that does exactly the same thing.\n\nJekyll's plugin:\n\n```ruby\n    module Jekyll\n      class ImageTag < Liquid::Tag\n        @url = nil\n        @caption = nil\n        @class = nil\n        @link = nil\n        // Patterns\n        IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION =\n        IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK = /(\\w+)(\\s+)((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s+)\"(.*?)\"(\\s+)->((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s*)/i\n        IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION = /((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))(\\s+)\"(.*?)\"/i\n        IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS = /(\\w+)(\\s+)((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))/i\n        IMAGE_URL = /((https?:\\/\\/|\\/)(\\S+))/i\n        def initialize(tag_name, markup, tokens)\n          super\n          if markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK\n            @class   = $1\n            @url     = $3\n            @caption = $7\n            @link = $9\n          elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION\n            @class   = $1\n            @url     = $3\n            @caption = $7\n          elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION\n            @url     = $1\n            @caption = $5\n          elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS\n            @class = $1\n            @url   = $3\n          elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL\n            @url = $1\n          end\n        end\n        def render(context)\n          if @class\n            source = \"<figure class='#{@class}'>\"\n          else\n            source = \"<figure>\"\n          end\n          if @link\n            source += \"<a href=\\\"#{@link}\\\">\"\n          end\n          source += \"<img src=\\\"#{@url}\\\">\"\n          if @link\n            source += \"</a>\"\n          end\n          source += \"<figcaption>#{@caption}</figcaption>\" if @caption\n          source += \"</figure>\"\n          source\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    Liquid::Template.register_tag('image', Jekyll::ImageTag)\n```\n\nis written as this Hugo shortcode:\n\n    <!-- image -->\n    <figure {{ with .Get \"class\" }}class=\"{{.}}\"{{ end }}>\n        {{ with .Get \"link\"}}<a href=\"{{.}}\">{{ end }}\n            <img src=\"{{ .Get \"src\" }}\" {{ if or (.Get \"alt\") (.Get \"caption\") }}alt=\"{{ with .Get \"alt\"}}{{.}}{{else}}{{ .Get \"caption\" }}{{ end }}\"{{ end }} />\n        {{ if .Get \"link\"}}</a>{{ end }}\n        {{ if or (or (.Get \"title\") (.Get \"caption\")) (.Get \"attr\")}}\n        <figcaption>{{ if isset .Params \"title\" }}\n            {{ .Get \"title\" }}{{ end }}\n            {{ if or (.Get \"caption\") (.Get \"attr\")}}<p>\n            {{ .Get \"caption\" }}\n            {{ with .Get \"attrlink\"}}<a href=\"{{.}}\"> {{ end }}\n                {{ .Get \"attr\" }}\n            {{ if .Get \"attrlink\"}}</a> {{ end }}\n            </p> {{ end }}\n        </figcaption>\n        {{ end }}\n    </figure>\n    <!-- image -->\n\n### Usage\nI simply changed:\n\n    {% image full http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4136/4829260124_57712e570a_o_d.jpg \"One of my favorite touristy-type photos.

There are no hard and fast rules here except that `hugo server --watch` is your friend. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.\n\n### Clean up\nYou'll want to remove the Jekyll configuration at this point. If you have anything else that isn't used, delete it.\n\n## A practical example in a diff\n[Hey, it's Alex](http://heyitsalex.net/) was migrated in less than a _father-with-kids day_ from Jekyll to Hugo. You can see all the changes (and screw-ups) by looking at this [diff](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/alexandre-normand/compare/869d69435bd2665c3fbf5b5c78d4c22759d7613a...b7f6605b1265e83b4b81495423294208cc74d610).\n",
